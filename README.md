# \# Python TCP Port Scanner

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# This project is a lightweight TCP Connect Port Scanner built in Python.  

# It scans a target host over a specified port range and identifies open TCP ports.

# 

# The scanner uses Python’s built-in `socket` module to establish TCP connections and determine port status.

# 

# This tool was developed for educational purposes and authorized security testing only.
